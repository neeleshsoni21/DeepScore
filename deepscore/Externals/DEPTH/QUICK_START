== INSTALLATION ==
1. compile and generate executables
% cd DEPTH-2.0.0/bin
% make
2. download blast and UniRef90
(visit http://mspc.bii.a-star.edu.sg/tankp/download.html)
% unzip database.zip
3. set path and parameter
(check for predict_site.par to set relative path for UniRef90 database and blastpgp)

*** (new) ***
Binding site prediction with complementary evolutionary information
% cd workspace
% python ../bin/predict_site_auto.py 1MVT.pdb 1MVT predict_site.par

and look at the output file
*.pred.pdb:		  PDB file with B-factor column replaced by probability value
*.pdb.binary.pdb: PDB file with B-factor column replaced by binding-site classification (1: binding site, 0: non-binding site)
